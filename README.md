Deployed link: https://healthibot.herokuapp.com/
Arduino Code link: https://github.com/himanshushah05/Healthibot

## Running the code:
Due to glitches in the AWS server , our database Postgresql want configurd with the deployed link. However the real-time dashboard can be accessed by https://healthibot.herokuapp.com/accounts/dashboard .
The project is fully functional on local server but due to glitches problems were posed in live deployment.

## Product Description
Health-i-bot is a health monitoring bot resembling the shape and size of a Blood pressure machine ,  where we need to connect the finger of the patient to sensor of the bot and it will measure the temperature, pulse levels and oxygen levels and send the data to Thingspeak IOT cloud where we make it accessible to the doctors and attendants on our website in real time.

## Problem Statement
Online consultation and home quarantine might be the need of the hour for most covid patients as there is a shortage of beds in most hospitals and even if there is an available bed, it will be given to only “serious patients”.
But it struck our minds that what is the exact line between a serious patient and a non serious patient ? And how efficient is Online Consultation?With new double and triple mutations of the virus coming in, the virus is becoming stronger and now it takes 3-4 days for a “non serious patient” to become a “serious patient” . 
Regular Diagnostics of health levels are really important to track the patients at home.
With oximeters being out of stock and high demands have inflated prices to Rs 4000+ , its accessibility to the economically weaker is questionable.
Due to possible chances of transmission, its really difficult for the attendants to come close to patient every hour to regularly test their pulse , temperature and oxygen levels and patients with symptoms of weakness find it very difficult to diagnose themselves.

## Solution Proposal
The solution we designed to address the problem is a health monitoring bot resembling the shape and size of a Blood pressure machine ,  where we need to connect the finger of the patient to sensor of the bot and it will measure the temperature, pulse levels and oxygen levels and send the data to Thingspeak IOT cloud where we make it accessible to the doctors and attendants on our website in real time.
The attendant can share the patient dashboard with the doctor enabling the doctor to provide necessary consultation as and when required.
The attendant and online doctor can now regularly track  the health status of the patient without being in person contact with the patient.

## Tech Stack
HTML5 , CSS3
Bootstrap
Django framework
Chartist.js
Thingspeak IOT Cloud
REST APIs

## Use Case / Future Scope
The product will help users and doctor to predict emergency situations before hand and help in saving the precious lives.
State of the art sensor infrastructure will be used in developing the bot in large scale.
We can enable our users to get in touch with the nearby hospitals directly over phone or by sending a bed request.
This product can greatly help in covering the gap of online and offline doctor consultations.
